e.g.
Let m(t) = -2*t. Let h(d) = d**2 + 6*d. Let g(k) = 2*h(k) + 4*m(k). Factor g(v).
but with 2 functions instead of 3
-> substitution without function evaluation
e.g.
Let c(b) = -b - b + 2 + 3*b. Let i be c(5). Let -x**3 + 3*x**3 - 9*x - 12*x**2 - 2 - i*x**3 = 0. What is x?
Let i be xyz. Let -x**3 + 3*x**3 - 9*x - 12*x**2 - 2 - i*x**3 = 0. What is x?
